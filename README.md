# Implementation and design
This is a simple program that reads persons' data (SSN, name, address, email) from a file and allows the user to search a person's data by SSN. The user also has the option of updating a person's address. 

Each line from the file is spilt into four tokens (SSN, name, address, email) which are used to create Person objects. Each Person object is then stored in a fixed length array.
